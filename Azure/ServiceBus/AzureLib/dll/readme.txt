This folder contains the latest version of the dot net Azure dll for referencing from Powershell scripts.
Some of the powershell commands for dot net do not provide the full granularity you can get from
the dot net Azure dll. We reference it so we can get the latest Azure methods in our powershell.

Typically you will get the Microsoft.ServiceBus.dll from a NuGet package in one of your dot net solutions referencing it.
